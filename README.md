# SLR-parser-table-in-cpp
This project implements a C++ code which builds an SLR(1) parser table, given the production rules of a grammar. The code outputs the parsing process step by step and shows the status after each step. The SLR table is printed using C++ in which "ACC" denotes the entry for which the input is accepted after parsing. The only drawback of this code is that the grammar cannot contain terminals with length more than one.
